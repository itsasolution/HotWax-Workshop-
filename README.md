# Git workings

what is commit -> simplified like saving code  
stage changes  -> saving locally on my machine  
commit messege -> what we changed in our code, we can add a messege for better understanding of the code  


During the session, he provided hands-on experience, guiding us through creating a repository, adding code, and demonstrating how Git works step by step.  
We also explored how branches function, the differences between public and private repositories, and why Git stands out compared to other tools and platforms, many of which are paid.  


# For Hardik Bhaiya
His teaching style was polite, friendly, and engaging, making the session enjoyable and easy to follow. He had a natural ability to capture everyoneâ€™s attention, and his approachable nature encouraged us to participate actively.  

Overall, it was a great learning experience. The workshop not only provided a clear understanding of Git and GitHub but also boosted my confidence in using these tools effectively.
